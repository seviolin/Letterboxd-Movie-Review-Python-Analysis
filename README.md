# Letterboxd-Movie-Review-Python-Analysis
A data analysis project using Python to explore and visualize movie review data from Letterboxd that I found in Kaggle. This repository includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and insights into trends such as most-watched directors, top-rated films, runtime extremes, and more.

## Dataset
The dataset contains the following coloumns:
- No
- Film_title
- Director
- Average_rating
- Genres
- Runtime
- Original_language
- Description
- Studios
- Watches
- List_appearance
- Likes
- Fans
- 1_star
- 3_stars
- 5_stars
- Total_ratings

## Features:
- Identifies top 5 directors with the most movies watched
- Identifies language distribution
- Aggregates watch counts, film appearances, and ratings
- Lists movies with the most appearances across curated lists
- Finds shortest and longests films by runtime
- Uses pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn for analysis and visualization
